### Storytelling Report: Maternal Mental Health During COVID-19

#### Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic created a unique and challenging environment for maternal and infant health, influencing mental well-being, birth outcomes, and perceptions of risk. Through analyzing this dataset, we explored various factors affecting women during this time, such as socioeconomic status, maternal age, education, and mental health outcomes like depression and anxiety. Below is a detailed narrative capturing key insights in an accessible and engaging manner.

### Observations on the Overall Dataset

**Distribution Patterns:**Most variables displayed a bell-shaped distribution, indicating normality, while a few exhibited slight skewness. Importantly, there were no major outliers, which ensured the integrity of the analysis.

### Insights Into Maternal Mental Health

#### Maternal Age and Mental Health

1.  **Ages 25-38:**Women in this age group generally experienced lower levels of anxiety and depression, showcasing their resilience and ability to manage health during pregnancy effectively.
    
2.  **Age 42 and Older:**Older mothers faced significantly higher risks, including elevated anxiety levels and a greater likelihood of preterm births (before 7.5 months). Their age appeared to amplify worries related to childbirth and infant health.
    

#### Mental Health Impacts of the Pandemic

The pandemic had a varying impact across age groups:

*   **Younger Women (<25) and Older Women (>45):** These groups exhibited notably higher anxiety levels, possibly due to concerns about health risks and limited access to resources.
    
*   **Women Aged 25-42:** This group reported lower levels of pandemic-related anxiety, indicating greater adaptability or access to support systems.
    

### Birth Outcomes and Delivery Insights

#### Gestational Age, Birth Length, and Weight

*   **Healthy Ranges:** The average gestational age (38-40 weeks), birth length (50 cm), and birth weight (3000 grams) were within healthy norms, reflecting overall positive birth outcomes.
    

#### Mode of Delivery

*   **Vaginal Deliveries Dominate:** Most women had vaginal deliveries, indicating relatively uncomplicated pregnancies.
    
*   **C-Section Risks for Older Mothers:** Women over 38 were 13% more likely to require C-sections, likely due to physiological changes with age.
    

#### NICU Admissions

*   Babies with **unhealthy birth weight** had a **22% higher chance** of requiring NICU care. Anxiety and depression in mothers also played a key role in predicting NICU admissions, highlighting the interconnectedness of maternal mental health and infant care.
    

### The Role of Socioeconomic Status

#### Income and Mental Health

*   **Lower Income Brackets (<$70,000):** Women from low-income households were disproportionately affected, with 70% experiencing anxiety or depression. Financial instability exacerbated their mental health challenges during the pandemic.
    
*   **Higher Income Groups:** These women faced fewer mental health challenges, emphasizing the protective role of financial stability.
    

#### Educational Influence

*   **Less Educated Mothers:** Nearly half of the women with less than a high school diploma experienced depression, underscoring the need for targeted interventions for this group.
    
*   **Highly Educated Mothers:** Advanced education (e.g., master’s or doctoral degrees) was associated with significantly lower anxiety and depression rates, offering a buffer against pandemic-related stress.
    

### Interconnected Factors: Education and Income

1.  **Impact of Education on Perceptions of Threats:**Women with higher education perceived lower risks to their life and baby’s safety. For example, women with doctoral degrees reported significantly less concern compared to those with only a high school diploma.
    
2.  **Combined Effects of Income and Education:**Surprisingly, women with higher education but low income shared similar levels of anxiety with those who had high income but lower education. This suggests that both education and income are crucial for managing mental health and perceived risks during pregnancy.
    

### Insights on Depression and Anxiety

#### Strong Correlation Between Depression and Anxiety

Women with high Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores were 81% likely to experience severe anxiety. This highlights the intertwined nature of these two conditions, especially during stressful times like the pandemic.

#### Education’s Protective Effect

*   **Women with Doctoral Degrees:** Only 17% experienced significant depression, demonstrating how advanced education fosters resilience.
    
*   **Women with Less Than a High School Diploma:** This group was the most vulnerable, with nearly half experiencing severe depression. Lack of access to resources and knowledge likely contributed to these outcomes.
    

### COVID-19’s Amplification of Risks

Regardless of income or education, all mothers expressed heightened concerns about their babies’ safety during the pandemic. However, these worries were more pronounced in low-income households, where financial instability added layers of anxiety.

### Practical Recommendations

1.  **Support for Vulnerable Groups:**Women with low income or education require targeted mental health interventions, financial aid, and community programs to reduce stress during pregnancy.
    
2.  **Emphasis on Maternal Mental Health:**Screening for depression and anxiety should be integral to prenatal care, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.
    
3.  **Education Programs:**Increasing access to educational resources for young women can equip them with better coping mechanisms and improve long-term maternal health outcomes.
    
4.  **Tailored Support for Older Mothers:**Women aged 42 and above need specialized care, given their higher risks for complications and mental health challenges.
    

### Conclusion

This analysis shines a light on the complex interplay between mental health, socioeconomic factors, and birth outcomes in maternal health during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many women showed resilience, significant disparities persisted among vulnerable groups, underscoring the need for inclusive policies and interventions. By addressing these challenges holistically, we can ensure healthier outcomes for both mothers and their babies.
